About
============
Do you want to manage timesheet by calendar? This module is useful to manage timesheet by weekly, monthly & daily. You can schedule timesheet activity by project, task, duration, employee, description, amount, date, time & unit of measure. Currently, in timesheet you can't add date and time, you can easily add from date & time to date & time and it will auto calculate total duration from that date and time. Hurray!
